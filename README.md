# Squad_Select
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Squad Select is an "optimal pipeline for group recommendation" developed as a part of the coursework Information Storage and Retrieval (CSCE 670) under the guidance of Dr. James Caverlee. 

The entire project documentation is found here: https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/group-recommendation/home 
Dataset used: Camra2011 : https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/group-recommendation 

Extra_Trials branch has a few Implicit Recommendation experiments we performed outside our project. This might be continued later with similar experimentation like current work. We uploaded this because base code structure is already created for implicit as well and we did not want to lose the scripts for future work.
